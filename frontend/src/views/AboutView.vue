      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        The Jersey Honesty Box project is all about supporting local farmers and connecting communities
        with fresh, local produce. Our platform promotes sustainable, transparent shopping directly from
        the source — with no middlemen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a Jersey resident or a visitor, you'll find a network of honesty boxes across
        the island offering everything from seasonal vegetables to homemade jams. By using our interactive map,
        you can explore, discover, and support local agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in trust, quality, and simplicity — values that are at the heart of every honesty box.
